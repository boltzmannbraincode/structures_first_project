# structures_first_project
project for the first lab of data & file structures class at my university
Essentialy, what was asked is the following:
1)Create a binary file with N random numbers, and write the data using 1000 byte buffers, one by one, and measure
and print how many times the disk was accessed.
2)Read from the first file using buffers again, and write to the disk 10 sorted binary files, again using buffers
and measuring disk accesses.
3)Read from those 10 files using buffers, and output a single sorted file.
4)Perform binary and serial search for a set amount of times with random numbers, measuring the average disk 
access count on each search, to see how binary search is super-effective.

To run the whole program, you need to place the .py files in the same directory, and execute the files with the order:
1)filemaker.py
2)filesort.py
3)filesort_merge.py
4)final_search_file.py
